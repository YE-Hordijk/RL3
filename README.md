These files are used to execute the code for assignment 3 of Reinforcement Learning.

Execute `python REINFORCE.py` to run a single learning run for REINFORCE, or
`python ActorCritic.py` to run a learning run for ActorCritic.
To perform experiments comparing the two algorithms, simply execute `python Experiment.py`.
These scripts will place their output in numpy files. To plot the results of our experiment
comparing RF and AC, simply run `python plot.py` and follow the prompts. Running this same
command also allows you to plot other numpy files generated by the algorithm. For example,
hyperparameter studies were performed by changing Experiments.py to run the RunParameters
function. This writes to different numpy files, which were then plotted using plot.py as well.
